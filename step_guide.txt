Radio AI Disc Jockey

I am working on a multifaceted project that I want to wrap using python3

step 1: get a listing of songs from a directory

step 2: randomly select N songs and prompt user to select one

step 3: download content about song: wikipedia page on song, or artist, or if no wikipedia page, go to allmusic or last.fm

step 4: use obtained content about song to ollama model with prompt to get DJ introduction

step 5: use TTS to read aloud the disc jockey

step 6: play song

step 7: randomly select N songs and use ollama LLM to choose most similar song to previously played song

go to step 3 (repeat)
